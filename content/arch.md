Software Architecture refers to the relationships between software elements.
                    Typically software has to do three things: retrieve and store data, perform
                    calculations using that data and finally display the data. How a software system
                    decides to make these three elements work together is what software architecture
                    defines. A prominent type of software architecture is the MVC architecture,
                    where a Model takes care of retrieving and storing data and performing
                    calculations on the data, a View takes care of displaying and modifying the data
                    and a Controller acts as the link between the Model and the View by telling the
                    View to update if the Model changes and vice versa.

                    Software architecture typically only focus on the elements that are hard to
                    change once the system is developed. For instance the software architecture is
                    not concerned with how you decide to show data in the View, but it will define
                    how you send data to from the Model to the Controller. Making these simple rules
                    early in the development process can save loads of time later.
