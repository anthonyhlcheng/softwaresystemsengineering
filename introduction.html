                      <p class="text-faded"> It is not as common for a firm to develop a brand new system nowadays as many would prefer to use existing systems that are familiar with the users and firms dislike the hassle of reimplementing a new, complex system. Therefore, the expansion of pre-existing embedded systems needs to meet ever-changing requirements, dictated by consumer demand and stakeholders, that will inevitably be tougher and more rigorous. <br><br>
                          Currently, the most important problem to solve is the development of such a system that performs well in many conditions and is able to adapt to changes to its environment. To keep up with such demands as time progresses, it is necessary for research to be carried out on improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of such systems by looking into the design, development, implementation, testing and maintenance phases during the whole process. </p>

                      <p>The first usage of the term Software Engineering was used by Anthony Oettinger in a letter in 1965 but the term only came into fruition in 1968<sup>1</sup> with the international conference as requested by the Study Group on Computer Science of the NATO Science Committee.<sup>2</sup><br><br>

The software crisis in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s helped people realise the problems associated with software development due to the field's infancy. Projects were known to be costly and the lack of quality control at the time contributed to fraud, identity theft and even death (Therac-25 accident)<sup>3</sup>.<br><br>

Researchers and firms scrambled to find a single solution by creating software tools to try and solve the software crisis. This was known as the Silver Bullet. By then, it was more expensive to maintain software than to develop a new system; an average project would pass its deadline by 50% and 75% of products that were delivered failed or were not used within the firm.<sup>4</sup> Tools, discipline, methods, processes and professionalism were all scrutinised or developed on to find the silver bullet of Software Engineering. Fred Brooks of IBM at that time discussed that there would be no silver bullet as nothing could ever make productivity increase rapidly. After much debate, it was determined that no silver bullet would ever be found especially to solve multiple problems.<br><br>

In the past decade, an explosion of demand from smaller firms prompted the development of cheaper solutions which involved finding faster, more efficient methodologies that would improve the Software Engineering process.</p>
