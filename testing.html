                        From the start of software development up until 1956, testing and debugging a program were the same thing.<br>
                        From 1957 to 1978, the two started to separate with testing was more to do with whether the program satisfied the requirements.
                        This was known as the Demonstration oriented period.<br>
                        In 1979, it was formalised by Glenford J. Myers that the two should be clearly defined as separate processes. This led onto many
                        in the software development community wanting to break down what was then debugging, even further into smaller subtopics.<br>
                        From 1979 to 1982, began the destruction phase, where the whole point of testing was to find errors.<br>
                        From 1983-1987, the evaluation phase began where it started to focus more on quality and evaluation of the product.<br>
                        From 1988, the prevention phase was introduced where testing had to ensure that defects were found and prevented and the overall product met its requirements.<sup id="threecf"><a href="#threec" class="page-scroll" style="color:#000;">3</a></sup>

                          Test levels are a hierarchy that uses different kinds of tests as the project progresses. There are four different levels that are part of the standard. Unit Testing; Integration Testing
                          System Testing and Acceptance Testing. As shown in the diagram below, the different tests are designed for more complex items as you go further into developing a project.

                        Unit Testing: <br>
                        Unit testing aims to verify each component of the software by separating it from the rest of the code and performing tests that show that it is in full working order.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Integration Testing: <br>
                        Integration testing aims to test multiple components, to see if they correctly work together. <br><br>
                        System Testing: <br>
                        System testing tests all components within the software to ensure that it means specifications that the software must have. It is important to get this stage of the testing process
                        correct as this is almost the finished product that the end users will expect to see.<br><br>
                        Acceptance Testing: <br>
                        This is where the product will be tested to a point where testers can say that the product can go ahead and be deployed. The tests can range anywhere from finding grammatical errors
                        to finding major security errors.<sup id="fourcf"><a href="#fourc" class="page-scroll" style="color:#000;">4</a></sup>

                        The kind of development model chosen by management has a great effect on how testing is carried out.<br><br>
                        Waterfall Development Model<br>
                        It is very common practice to wait for the whole product to be developed before testing is carried out. Developers have no idea how good the software works until it nears the
                        very end of the whole process. If it fails, it has to go back to the development and the process repeated.
                        <br><br>
                        Agile or Extreme Programming <br>
                        Within these two processes, unit tests are coded first and tests done on components. It is expected to fail and as this is done again and again, the component will become better over
                         time. As more components are built, the next level of testing is introduced whilst unit testing is still in progress for the rest of the project lifecycle. The goal is to increase
                         the amount of testing effort done and do testing more often.<br><br>
                        Top Down and Bottom Up<br>
                      Top down is when testers test the highest level of components / systems and work their way down towards smaller components. Bottom up is the opposite. This is only helpful when the whole
                      system has been developed and helps the reporting of testing progress in a quantitive form.<sup id="fivecf"><a href="#fivec" class="page-scroll" style="color:#000;">5</a></sup>

                          More and more testing involves some sort of automation and there are tools out there to help. Although automation cannot completely reproduce results that manual testing can achieve,
                          it can be useful for regression testing or very repetitive testing tasks.

                        Formatted dump or symbolic debugging allows testers to view errors at certain points of a program.
                        <br>
                        Automated Functional GUI testing tools repeat certain tests through the GUI.
                        <br>
                        Benchmarks allow testers to view performance data that could be essential to see if it meets time requirements etc.<br>

                        REducing the Cost of Oracles for Software Testing. As explained before, an oracle is "a mechanism for determining whether a test has passed or failed"<sup id="sevencf"><a href="#sevenc" class="page-scroll" style="color:#000;">7</a></sup>.
                        Determining whether the correct behaviour is achieved that may be simple for humans but harder for the software to decide - this is called the oracle problem.<sup id="eightcf"><a href="#eightc" class="page-scroll" style="color:#000;">8</a></sup>
                        What RE-COST will do is develop Search Based Optimisation techniques to solve the Oracle Cost problem.
